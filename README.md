🐳 Narwhal Problems 💰
======================

An app for helping NEAR Whales (narwhals) carry their heavy bags of tokens.
Poor narwhals!


Are you a narwhal, too?
=======================

Do you have several buckets full of NEAR tokens?

Do you have these spread out across multiple hardware and/or software wallets?

Do you already have trouble keeping track of all that, and then a need to keep
track of lockup contracts, delegation decisions, staking rewards, and starting
balances?

This app is for you!


Run it locally
==============

* Make sure you have [Node.js]
* Clone the code
* `cd` into the repo
* `npm i`
* `npm run dev`

Bonus Features For People Running It Locally
============================================

This project has a couple files in `gitignore` for you. This means if you create these files, you won't accidentally commit them to the codebase
* `accounts.json` – go ahead and copy the data from the app into this file for a less-transient way to store it
* `picking-validators.md` – you can use this file as a handy personal notepad when figuring out which validators to delegate to
