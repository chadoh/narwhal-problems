  <p>An app for helping NEAR Whales (narwhals) carry their heavy bags of tokens. Poor narwhals!</p>

  <h1>Are you a narwhal, too?</h1>

  <p>Do you have several buckets full of NEAR tokens?</p>

  <p>Spread across many hardware wallets?</p>

  <p>Locked in lockup contracts?</p>

  <p>Do you already have trouble tracking all that, then also need to keep tabs on validators, your total liquid
    balance, etc?</p>

  <p>This app is for you!</p>

  <p>Click "Add Account" to start making your own Narwhal Dashboard.</p>
